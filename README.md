## :scroll: Description

Petoption is a modern pet adoption app that will help you find your special pet in no time.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context

The most interesting part of my submission is the fact that I was able to build a beautiful modern app from scratch and still have fun doing it. I'm so proud of Jetpack Compose and the Jetpack Compose team, they've really come a long way. looking forward to the stable release :smile:.
